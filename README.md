## Rules
Build your empire by creating cities, and use the resources these provide to build an army of chess pieces.  
Last player with a city standing wins!

Each tile provides one growth (yellow) and one production (purple), but some tiles provide bonus resources! Each tile within your city's borders provides you with it's growth and production every turn.

Use growth to expand your city's borders (making it more effective) and use production to build units and more cities. 

Send your units into battle against the opponent and take down their cities to win!
